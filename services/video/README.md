# User Service
This service handles authentication and friendships.

## Nodable Technologies
* Neo4j - Graph database for storing user and relationship data
* JWT - JSON Web Token-based authentication, allowing for stateless authentication across different services

## TODO
* Complete API endpoints
* Write tests for API endpoints using supertest
* Add support for friend requests (instead of automatic friendships)
